1. 
.data: Subsequent items put in user data segment (binary rep of data in source file).
.word: Store the n 32-bit quantities in successive memory words.
.text: Subsequent items put in user text segment (machine code).
2.34, which represents the 10th Fibonacci number.
3.0x10000010
4.set t3 to 12 -> 144.


1.What do the .data, .word, .text directives mean (i.e. what do you use them for)? Hint: think about the 4 sections of memory.
2.Run the program to completion. What number did the program output? What does this number represent?
3.At what address is n stored in memory? Hint: Look at the contents of the registers.
4.Without actually editing the code (i.e. without going into the “Editor” tab), have the program calculate the 13th fib number (0-indexed) by manually modifying the value of a register. You may find it helpful to first step through the code. If you prefer to look at decimal values, change the “Display Settings” option at the bottom.
